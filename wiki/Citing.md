## Instructions for creating a release for one of the packages

For the purpose of this section, let's refer to whichever of Animate, Goalie, and Movement you want to cite as `<package>`.

1. Go to ``https://github.com/mesh-adaptation/<package>``.
2. Click "create a new release" on the right hand side.
3. Select the branch and/or commit you want to release and add a title and description.
4. Create a tag for your release using the drop-down menu. We recommend creating a new tag with the format `<Package>_YYYYMMDD`, e.g., `Animate_20240415`.
5. Make an actual release (not a pre-release) for Zenodo to notice.
6. Click the green "Publish release" button.
